# 🤓💻📋 Readable Project

Final assessment project for Udacity's *React & Redux* course.

### To get started developing you need to:

* clone this repo and `cd` into it
* `cd` into `api-server` folder
* install all server dependencies with `npm install` (or `yarn`)
* run the backend server with `npm start`

then:

* open a new terminal window and `cd` into the project folder you've just cloned
* install all project dependencies with `npm install` (or `yarn`)
* start the frontend server with `npm start` (or `yarn start`)

If everything went smoothly you can now open and view the application at `localhost:3000` on your local machine and interact with it (if it hasn't already opened automatically).

## ⚙️ Backend Server
* I've implemented the interface to the APIs: [`ReadableAPI.js`](src/utils/ReadableAPI.js).
* The API server itself was provided by Udacidy ([see repository here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter))

### 📓 Notes
This project was bootstrapped with [`Create React App`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
